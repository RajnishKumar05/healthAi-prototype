## Introduction
HealthAI is an AI-driven healthcare tool designed to assist in disease diagnosis and treatment recommendations. By analyzing **medical reports, images, and patient symptoms**, the system provides possible cures and treatments. Additionally, the platform enables **comprehensive patient profile monitoring** to track their health over time.

We utilize cutting-edge AI models such as **BioGPT for generative AI**, **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for image-based disease identification**, and **BART for simplifying complex medical information** into easily understandable terms. Our approach also integrates **self-supervised learning** to enhance model performance.
